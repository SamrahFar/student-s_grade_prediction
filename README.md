## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open `notebooks/Final_project.ipynb` and run cells sequentially.

## Data Description

The dataset (`data/student-mat.csv`) includes demographic, social, and academic information for students. Features include:

- Categorical: sex, school, address, family background, parental education, etc.
- Numerical: age, absences, grades (G1, G2, G3), study time, failures, and more.

The target variable is `G3` (final grade).

---

## Usage

- Load the data and explore its structure.
- Visualize attribute distributions and correlations.
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Build and evaluate regression models.
- Use results to inform strategies for student support and intervention.
